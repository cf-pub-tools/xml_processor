    <abstract>
      <para>The Hortonworks Data Platform, powered by Apache Hadoop, is a massively scalable
        and 100% open source platform for storing, processing and analyzing large volumes of
        data. It is designed to deal with data from many sources and formats in a very
        quick, easy and cost-effective manner. The Hortonworks Data Platform consists of the
        essential set of Apache Hadoop projects including MapReduce, Hadoop Distributed File
        System (HDFS), HCatalog, Pig, Hive, HBase, Zookeeper and Ambari. Hortonworks is the
        major contributor of code and patches to many of these projects. These projects have
        been integrated and tested as part of the Hortonworks Data Platform release process
        and installation and configuration tools have also been included.
      </para>
      <para>Unlike other providers of platforms built using Apache Hadoop, Hortonworks
        contributes 100% of our code back to the Apache Software Foundation. The Hortonworks
        Data Platform is Apache-licensed and completely open source. We sell only expert
        technical support,

        will remain free and open source.
